# protein-ligand-binding-affinity-prediction
Binding energy of a unknown protein ligand interaction can be predcited utilizing machine learning. We have used Random Forest algorithm of the weka pacakge for the prediction.
Training data set is provided here. Regression dataset will give absolute value of predcited binding erergy and the decoy dataset will give an idea about the feasilibilty of interaction.
