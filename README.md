# protein-ligand-binding-affinity-prediction
Binding energy of a unknown protein ligand interaction can be predcited utilizing machine learning. We have used Random Forest algorithm of the weka pacakge for the prediction.
Training data set is provided here. Regression dataset will give absolute value of predcited binding erergy and the decoy dataset will give an idea about the feasilibilty of interaction.

S1 contains the list of proteins used in our experiments. S2 contains the lists of features of proteins and ligands used for regression. S3 contains figures representing error count for prediction on datasets. S4 contains the list of top ranked features.
